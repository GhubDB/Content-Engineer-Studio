priorities:
save testing output to excel
add chat messages dynamically ignore empty messages.
implement auto queues 
-> right click to add to qlineedit 
-> add +1 to a property every time new dialog is pressed and use modulo on that property to set bg color
fix tearDown issues
fix sleep freezes
implement search box auto expand/shrink
implement FAQ auto search

Analysis suite
webscraping chat sessions for customer messages
- displaying messages and allow users to select/deselect them
- editing parts of the message so as to anonymize parts
- analyzing customer messages for parts to anonymize
- turning auto anonymizing on and off
- check if it's actually a safe link

webscrpaping chat sessions for bot messages
- analyzing bot messages for relevance
- displaying messages and allow users to select/deselect them

webscraping bot flows and suggesting relevant flows
- displaying flows and allow users to select/deselect them
- allow user to select a better suited flow/FAQ if the bot chose the wrong one and add both the correct and the incorrect flow/FAQ to Excel
- auto select according to database


read and edit open excel files
- open pages from links in excel for webscraping
- update open file with values from studio 
- navigate cells
- display completed and uncompleted rows
- display filename and worksheet in status bar

options
- turn webscraping on and off
- prompt user when overwriting existing data
- mark cells that are being worked on
- automate syncing open excel file to local disk
- automate detecting open excel files

implement preloading and caching feature that loads the next x chat sessions and starts analysis queues so the user can continue immediately.
count the highlighted flows & bot answers on every save and make the program learn from user input

display relevant FAQ for flows

opening chat test environment and webscraping the results
- insert text version of the chat into excel
- insert screenshot version of the chat into excel

ev. webscraping bot confidence measurements

Testing suite

enter test sentence
program opens test chat and enters test sentence, retrieves answer when ready.
program matches answer to faq/flow 
user selects if correct answer was given. if not, user can select the correct faq/flow
allow users to suggest a FAQ that is better suited if the one that is used works, but is not ideal.
optional Notes
write output to excel file
have the option to resubmit the previous n questions.
structure the excel file by FAQ ID and flow ID

make file searchable by questions where the bot fails to provide the correct answers.

once updates are made to faq's or flows retest all collected sentences against the new flows or FAQ's
generate output that shows which of the previously tested questions do not work with the new changes.
run selenium on server. it is infinitely scalable
create a history of performance metrics for each FAQ/flow. automate reporting and chart generation.


enter testing suite from the analysis suite and carry over the data. 
save user configuration and the user's position in the excel sheet/workbook

maybe allow users to add tested questions directly to variants with the necessary highlighting

have FAQ search field check if this question has been tested. show green for untested , red for tested recently, orange for tested a long time ago
have search field check other excel lists for questions similar to the one asked and suggest search terms to the user.

Future prospects
- 


##################################################################
requires further access/data
- writing settings to file or to registry
- displaying relevant flows and adding screenshots or path data to excel table
- open and auto fill tickets
- allow categorizing of cases and adding the details to existing open issues in order to collect them in one location.

Notes:
- source.objectName() will find the object name from the source of an event
- self.sender() will find the id of the element that fired the event
- setContextMenuPolicy(Qt::ContextMenuPolicy policy) translates to combo.setContextMenuPolicy(Qt.PreventContextMenu)
- self.chat.cellWidget(0, 0) will get the widget in the specified cell. Use .toplainText() to get the text contents.
- print(wb.sheets) will show the sheets of a workbook

- df.iloc[1,0].values will give a list with the values at grid location 1,0
- df.iloc[0:5, 0:3].values will give lists in the specified saveOnRowChange
- a dataframe of the specified range will be returned if .values is not used
- use self.df_2.columns.values to get header strings

- use for message in messages:
    message.get_attribute('class') or message.get_property('class') for checking element attributes

Bugs:
    '''Bugfix for number only entries on the excel sheet needed. 
        File "c:\Users\Me\Dropbox\Python\Content Engineer Studio\main_window.py", line 348, in populate_analysis
    self.analysis.setText(self.df.loc[self.row][self.cell_selector.currentIndex() + self.cell_selector_start])
    TypeError: setText(self, str): argument 1 has unexpected type 'numpy.float64'''
----
    fix needed for display of self.chat during webscraping. user selections are not registered if entered during this time.
----
    check signal filter for chat_2 vs chat
